# Human_Emotion_recognition

## Abstract:
Human Emotion recognition is an essential area of research in computer vision and machine learning that aims to identify and classify human emotions from facial expressions. Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a subfield of this area that uses machine learning algorithms to automatically detect and classify facial expressions into different emotion categories such as happy, angry, sad, surprised, etc.

## Problem Statement: 
The Fer-2013 dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of facial expression recognition. It contains 35,887 grayscale images of faces with 48x48 pixels, labeled with one of seven emotion categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral. This project focuses on binary classification of angry and happy emotions using the Fer-2013 dataset. The objective is to develop a robust model that can accurately identify and classify facial expressions as either angry or happy. The project will involve the following steps:
